#  Harmonizing the Parts of Speech 
## Objective
The code utilizes NLTK to identify and categorize parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs) in a given paragraph. It tokenizes the text and performs part-of-speech tagging to 
extract relevant words. Punctuation marks are excluded from consideration to ensure accurate results.
### Details
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): is a Python library used for natural language processing tasks, including text analysis, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and more. It provides tools and resources for working with human language data efficiently.
Tokenization:Tokenization is the process of breaking a text or a sentence into individual units, typically words or phrases, known as tokens. It is a crucial step in natural language processing for text analysis and language understanding.
### Summary
This code uses the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library for natural language processing tasks. It defines a function `identify_parts_of_speech` that takes a paragraph as input and tokenizes it into sentences and words. It then performs part-of-speech tagging on each word and categorizes them into respective lists (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives). Punctuation marks are excluded from consideration. In the main part, a sample paragraph is analyzed, and the identified parts of speech are printed.
#### Code
1.import nltk:This line imports the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, which provides tools and resources for natural language processing tasks.
2.nltk.download('punkt'):This line downloads the 'punkt' dataset, which contains pre-trained models for tokenization. Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual units, such as words or sentences.
3.nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger'):This line downloads the 'averaged_perceptron_tagger' dataset, which contains pre-trained models for part-of-speech tagging. Part-of-speech tagging is the process of identifying the grammatical parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs) in a sentence.
4.from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize:This line imports the 'word_tokenize' and 'sent_tokenize' functions from the NLTK's 'tokenize' module. These functions are used for word and sentence tokenization, respectively.
5.from nltk import pos_tag:This line imports the pos_tag function from the NLTK. It is used for part-of-speech tagging.
6.import string:This line imports the 'string' module, which provides a collection of common string operations and constants.
7.def identify_parts_of_speech(paragraph):This line defines a function called 'identify_parts_of_speech' that takes a paragraph as input. The function will identify different parts of speech in the given paragraph.
8.sentences = sent_tokenize(paragraph):This line tokenizes the paragraph into sentences using the 'sent_tokenize' function and stores them in the 'sentences' list.
9.pos_tags = []:This line initializes an empty list 'pos_tags' to store the part-of-speech tags of words.
10.for sentence in sentences:This line starts a loop to iterate through each sentence in the 'sentences' list.
11.words = word_tokenize(sentence):This line tokenizes the sentence into words using the 'word_tokenize' function and stores them in the 'words' list.
12.pos_tags.extend(pos_tag(words)):This line performs part-of-speech tagging on the 'words' list using the 'pos_tag' function from NLTK. It adds the part-of-speech tags of the words to the 'pos_tags' list.
13.nouns = [],pronouns = [],adjectives = [],conjunctions = [],adverbs = [],verbs = [],prepositions = [],interjections = []:These lines initialize empty lists to store words belonging to different parts of speech.
14.punctuation_marks = set(string.punctuation):This line creates a set of punctuation marks from the 'string' module. It will be used to exclude words containing punctuation marks from being considered as parts of speech.
15.for word, pos in pos_tags:This line starts a loop to iterate through each word and its corresponding part-of-speech tag in the 'pos_tags' list.
16.if not any(char in punctuation_marks for char in word):This line checks if the word does not contain any punctuation marks.
17.if pos.startswith('N'):This line checks if the part-of-speech tag starts with 'N', which indicates a noun.
18.if pos.startswith('PR'):This line checks if the part-of-speech tag starts with 'PR', which indicates a pronoun.
19.if pos.startswith('JJ'):This line checks if the part-of-speech tag starts with 'JJ', which indicates an adjective.
20.if pos.startswith('CC'):This line checks if the part-of-speech tag starts with 'CC', which indicates a conjunction.
21.if pos.startswith('RB'):This line checks if the part-of-speech tag starts with 'RB', which indicates an adverb.
22.if pos.startswith('V'):This line checks if the part-of-speech tag starts with 'V', which indicates a verb.
23.if pos.startswith('IN'):This line checks if the part-of-speech tag starts with 'IN', which indicates a preposition.
24.if pos.startswith('UH'):This line checks if the part-of-speech tag starts with 'UH', which indicates an interjection.

The words are then appended to their respective lists based on their parts of speech.

Finally, the function returns the lists containing the words categorized into their respective parts of speech.

In the main part of the code, a sample paragraph is provided, and the 'identify_parts_of_speech' function is called to analyze the parts of speech present in the paragraph. The identified words are then printed for each category: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, conjunctions, adverbs, verbs, prepositions, and interjections.
